NETS_213_HW_6_CSV_Script.ipynb is a Python Colab Notebook that we created to scrape a Amazon Mechanical Turk results page for the data we needed as the CSV alone was insufficient. The script searches for a file called 'untitled.html' and then calculates the percent of tasks completed accurately.

images.zip contains all of the sets of images of traffic that the MTurk workers were asked to sort.
